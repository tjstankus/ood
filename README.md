In this take, the strategy pattern is employed. Typically the strategy pattern
is used to extract discrete logic into an object. The strategy approach can rid
code of complex conditional logic that differentiates on logic.

In this case, there is no logic differences, per se, but there are differences
in the content of generated strings, which lends itself, somewhat
asymptotically, to a strategy approach.
